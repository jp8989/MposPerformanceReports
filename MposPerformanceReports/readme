1) Dynamic web project
2) convert to maven : right click/configure/convert to maven
3) add log4j.properties file to src/main/resources
4) add MposPerformanceReports-servlet.xml to WebContent/WEB-INF
6) create web.xml and provide a name for the servlet
7) created src package...com.kwi.mpos.perfreports
	added ProfileExecution @interface for annotation.
	added ProfilingAdvisor.java
	added ProfilingMethodInterceptor.java
	added MposPerformanceReportsServlet.java
8) added spring, servlet, and slf4j dependencies to pom.xml


QUESTION: Why is it that when dragging/dropping file from another project i get errors like can't find import 
10) run maven clean install
11) start server

Could not deploy to tomcat 7.0

The server does not support 3.1 of the j2ee web module specification.
Tried to change with right-click project-->options/project facets/Web module tried to change to 2.5 

Notes from web...
Following these steps I continued to get stuck because 
I previously generated the web.xml
(with a right clic on <project>/Deployment Descriptor + Generate Deployment Descriptor Stub). 
I resolved this issue deleting the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml file. 
Note that web.xml is not mandatory anymore with servlet version later than 3.0 if you use annotations.

What is the difference between annotated beans or .xml config files for 
application context. 

http://howtodoinjava.com/2014/07/19/spring-mvc-difference-between-contextannotation-config-vs-contextcomponent-scan/

Context:annotation-config is used to activate applied annotatons in
already registered beans in application context.

context:component-scan does what context:annotatioon-config does 
and also it scans the packages and registers beans in application
context. 

copied all the config from MposPerformanceReports-servlet.xml to applicationContext.xml and it WORKED.
